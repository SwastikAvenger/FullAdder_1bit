In this project, I have designed a 1-bit Full Adder using a 1-bit Half Adder. 
The Half Adder was instantiated twice to provide a correct functionality of the full adder. 
The Sum output from the first Half Adder acts as an one input to the second half adder. 
The other input to the second half adder is the input carry value (carry value of the previous adder). 
The final Sum and Carry are taken from the outputs of the second half adder.
